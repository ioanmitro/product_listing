Set up a database:

Create a MySQL database and name it "order_history".
Create a table named "orders" with the following columns:
order_id (auto-incrementing primary key)
order_date (datetime)
user_id (integer, foreign key to user table)
item_name (text)
price_code (text)
quantity (integer)
total_cost (decimal)
Update the checkout process:

After the order is confirmed, save the order details to the "orders" table in the database, including the order_date, user_id, item_name, price_code, quantity, and total_cost.
Create a page to display order history:

Create a PHP page named "order_history.php".
Retrieve the order history for the currently logged-in user from the database.
Display the order details, including order_date, item_name, price_code, quantity, and total_cost, in a table format.
